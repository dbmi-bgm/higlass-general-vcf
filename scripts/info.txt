Cytoband data downloaded from here: http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/hg38/database/cytoBand.txt.gz
Only main chromosomes kept.

DELIMITERS HAVE BEEN ADDED MANUALLY

bgzip -c file.vcf > file.vcf.gz
tabix -p vcf file.vcf.gz


There should be little difference between the cytoBand.txt and the
cytoBandIdeo.txt
files. Each of our data tracks is supported by one file (table in the
database) with
coordinates for mapping. The *Ideo* file underlies the graphic display
of the
cytoband data in the small ideogram graphic above the main Browser display.

The cytoBandIdeo file/table has been modified from the cytoBand
file/table for
purposes of the display in the ideogram. The cytoBand table/file
underlies the
data track in the main Browser graphic and should be the file used for most
purposes.

The items in the last column refer to the coloring you see in the both the
Browser graphic and in the ideogram above. The first 5 in the list below
reflect the level of color obtained via Giemsa staining; "acen" is
centromeric;
"stalk" refers to the short arm of acrocentric chromosomes
chr13,14,15,21,22;
"gvar" bands tend to be heterochomatin, either pericentric or telomeric.
The
best way to see for your self is to look at the regions in the Genome
Browser.
